// Comment/uncomment so the desired model is the only defined one

#define NO54138 //no heater or jets when bubbles are on. 
//#define NO54173 //this is same as 54138 but can run heater on 50% when bubbles are on.
//#define NO54123 //not tested. ref https://github.com/mrQ000/layz-rc link to presentation slides
//#define NO54154 //no jets. Works for Palm Springs 54129


//WARNING: DEVICES HAVE DIFFERENT PINOUTS!!! CHECK BEFORE USING
//The 54123 should work also for 54112 judging from a comment from @jenswalit in the forum

//If using/testing the new PCB choose PCB_V2
#define PCB_V1
//#define PCB_V2  //The PCB with rounded corners
