WiFi outage won't stop program
	At first start-up, if ESP device doesn't have any wifi credentials, an autoportal will be started.
	Enter credentials and save. The program is blocked until this is done. 
	The CIO will function during the autoportal, but the display will not update and no commands will execute.
	
	Following start-ups, for example after power-out, the device runs without WiFi connection
	and tries to reconnect periodically to last working wifi network. The autoportal will not start,
	so if you change SSID or password on your router you have to resetwifi/ on the ESP first.
	If started without WiFi the internal clock will be way behind present time, 
	leading to command queue will delay scheduled events by a couple of years.
	Immidiate actions such as restoring last known states should still work.
	NTP will try to sync time after WiFi is reestablished.

	Display will show "check net" once a minute if wifi is lost.
